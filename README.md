# Record Of Ragnarok, Round 12 application form

This is a form for getting a ticket to see a fight between [Odin and Sakata kintoki](https://record-of-ragnarok.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_109) from this goated anime [Record Of Ragnarok](https://record-of-ragnarok.fandom.com/wiki/Shuumatsu_no_Valkyrie:_Record_of_Ragnarok_Wiki).

Well I know this idea is kinda absurd if you have read the manga because all the fights literally just take place in the heaven( *Valhalla* ) and you can just attend it as a soul. However, as this was a practice project to practice form-widgets, I found this a pretty cool idea ^~^
